# My Python Repository

## Everithing not trivial (for me ofc) that i found useful

## There are 3 folders

* CheatSheet -> where command are divided by argument
* Codes -> where i put the "useful" codes i create
* PythonBooks -> all the books i found usefull on the subject (ofc I have an hard copy of them!)

Enjoy!

# My Python Repository

## Everithing not trivial (for me ofc) that i learn on python will be in this repo.

## There are 3 folders

* CheatSheet -> where command are divided by argument
* Codes -> where i put the "useful" codes i create
* PythonBooks -> all the books i found usefull on the subject (ofc I have an hard copy of each one of then at home..)

Enjoy!
